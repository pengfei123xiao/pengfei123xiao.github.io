-----------------

## Research

### Personalized Recommendation via Importance Ranking (Nov. 2016 – Apr.2017)
* Propose a novel recommendation algorithm, which combines the importance of users or items with collabo-rative ﬁltering algorithm to improve both accuracy and eﬃciency of recommendation. 
* Speciﬁcally, it considers the recommender system as a bi-type heterogeneous information network and initially classiﬁes users or items into diﬀerent groups. Afterwards, with ranking information the cluster would be reﬁned, and in turn, the ranking results would be further boosted. 
* Supervised by [Prof.Junming Shao, Big Data Research Center, UESTC](http://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/shaojunming/zh_CN/index.htm)

## Professional Experience
Singulariti, Melbourne, Australia             	08/2019-11/2019
Data Engineer Intern
Responsibility
•	Customise docker images and write YAML files for bitbucket CI/CD pipeline
•	Assist in building data preprocessing pipeline via PySpark
•	Assist in reforming a prediction model based on Convolutional Neural Networks to predict mining machine failure probability

Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT University), Melbourne, Australia             11/2018-03/2019
Data Science Research Assistant Intern - Center of Information Discovery and Data Analytics
Responsibility
•	Deployed an efficient and reliable data pipeline on Melbourne On-Street Parking Data for further analysis and visualization
•		Proposed and realized a hybrid model that combines the time-series clustering model and Recurrent Neural Network model (LSTM) in predicting Melbourne parking area occupancy rate in the next 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes
•	Extracted and analyzed useful features, including nearby office/restaurant number, nearby restaurant business hour, public transportation condition, parking rules, etc., that influence the occupancy rate by analyzing the cluster distribution and the occupancy rate of different clusters
•	Visualized experimental results via Python and Tableau
Achievement	
•	The hybrid model reduces the error rate by around 20% compared with traditional (non-cluster) regression model
