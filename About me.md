-----------------

## Research

### Personalized Recommendation via Importance Ranking (Nov. 2016 – Apr.2017)
* Propose a novel recommendation algorithm, which combines the importance of users or items with collabo-rative ﬁltering algorithm to improve both accuracy and eﬃciency of recommendation. 
* Speciﬁcally, it considers the recommender system as a bi-type heterogeneous information network and initially classiﬁes users or items into diﬀerent groups. Afterwards, with ranking information the cluster would be reﬁned, and in turn, the ranking results would be further boosted. 
* Supervised by [Prof.Junming Shao, Big Data Research Center, UESTC](http://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/shaojunming/zh_CN/index.htm)

## Professional Experience
**Singulariti, Melbourne, Australia 08/2019-11/2019** <br>
Data Engineer Intern <br>
**Responsibility** <br>
•	Customise docker images and write YAML files for bitbucket CI/CD pipeline <br>
•	Assist in building data preprocessing pipeline via PySpark <br>
•	Assist in reforming a prediction model based on Convolutional Neural Networks to predict mining machine failure probability <br>

**Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT University), Melbourne, Australia 11/2018-03/2019** <br>
Data Science Research Assistant Intern - Center of Information Discovery and Data Analytics <br>
**Responsibility** <br>
•	Deployed an efficient and reliable data pipeline on Melbourne On-Street Parking Data for further analysis and visualization <br>
•	Proposed and realized a hybrid model that combines the time-series clustering model and Recurrent Neural Network model (LSTM) in predicting Melbourne parking area occupancy rate in the next 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes <br>
•	Extracted and analyzed useful features, including nearby office/restaurant number, nearby restaurant business hour, public transportation condition, parking rules, etc., that influence the occupancy rate by analyzing the cluster distribution and the occupancy rate of different clusters <br>
•	Visualized experimental results via Python and Tableau <br>
**Achievement**	 <br>
•	The hybrid model reduces the error rate by around 20% compared with traditional (non-cluster) regression model <br>

## Project Experiences

University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia <br>
Australia Politician support rate analysis via Twitter 03/2019-06/2019 <br>
•	Applied Twitter’s restful and streaming API to crawl political-related tweets in Australia from Twitter and stored the tweets in MongoDB <br>
•	Applied simple natural language processing techniques on tweets contents to analysis sentiments towards 280 politicians in Australia <br>
  	In specific, applied TF-IDF, BoW, N-Gram methods to extract the features from Twitter contents, then trained Naïve Bayesian, SVM models with IMDB dataset, and finally predicted the sentiment of Twitter contents with trained models <br>
•	Visualized overall support rates and daily changes in support rates; visualized politicians’ word cloud and daily popular hashtags <br>
•	Attempted to predict the 2019 Australian Federal Election results based on the above analysis and the accuracy is around 72% among 139 electoral districts <br>

Kaggle Competition
Elo Merchant Category Recommendation - Bronze Medal (Top 7%) 02/2019  <br>
•	Predicted user loyalty based on credit card records and therefore customised special offers and discounts for different users  <br>
•	Motivated by the RFM (Recency - Frequency - Monetary) model, created some additional features.  <br>
   The features are roughly divided into basic information features, time features, and amount features. They are filtered based on variance, Pearson correlation coefficients, etc.  <br>
•	Built prediction models based on XGBoost, LightGBM, Multilayer perceptron and blended the prediction results of these three models <br>

* An Intelligent Car based on ARMmbed, 2016 Spring
* Face Detection and Recognition Based on Matlab, 2015 Fall
* Construction of a simple RISC CPU, 2015 Spring
* Heart Rate Meters via Pulse Detection based on ARMmbed, 2015 Spring
